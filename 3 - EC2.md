# EC2 (Elastic Cloud Computer)

## Global Informations

* Regional service / Servers are running in a specific region
* Metadatqs are availables at : 169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/

## AMI (Amazon Machine Image)

* Available images with an OS and its configuration
* Images have a different id in each regions. (Image might have the smae config. But it is a different one)
* Different family are available for different purposes (Computing, General...). Inside family, there are different sizes (Better performance, better network...)

## Instance Configuration

* Network (VPC / subnet (AZ))
* User data is a script that is ran once at the startup.
* Storage
  * Seperate entity
* Tags used for automation
* Security group (act as a firewall)
* Key Pair to connect to a server via ssh (Default user is ec2-user)
* You can change the instance type (Stop -> Change -> Start)

## Status checks

* System. If there is a failure on the aws server, the status goes red. Stop - Start the instance to deploy it on another server
* Instance - You did something wrong on your instance, the status goes red. Fix it !

## Actions

* Reboot: Keeps the metadatas
* Stop - Start: Recreate everything
* You can create your own AMI from your instance

## EBS

* Volumes types:
  * General SSD
    * General purposes
  * Provisioned IOPS SSD (Expensive)
    * Critical business / Large databases
  * Throughput Optimized HDD (Intensive workloads)
    * Big data / Stream processing / Logging
  * Cold HDD
    * No performance needed / Cost optimized
* Classification:
  * Persistent => Storage is keep even if the instance goes down
  * Ephemeral => Lives with the instance. Data is lost when the server goes down
* Only attaches to one instance at a time
* Block storage
* You can increase the size, not decrease it
* You pay for the storage allocated

## EFS / FSx

* Network fs that can be share between different servers
* FS is mount to the target
* EFS for linux only (Shared across AZ, Regions, VPC, Account)
* FSx for windows and linux (Shared across AZ)

## Pricing

* On Demand Instances
  * Payed by the second or the hour depending of the AMI
  * Suitable for short / medium terms
* Reserved Instances
  * Suitable for long terms usage
  * Runs on top of a reservation. You purchase the instance for a given time
  * Reserved for 1 or 3 years
  * It's possible to schedule a window at what time the instance is running
* Spot Instances
  * Spared servers that are sold to costumers for a cheap price.
  * 2 min notification before terminating the instance
  * You receive a notification if AWS runs out of capacity
  * Spot block - Reserved instance for a given time. At the end, the instance is terminated
* Dedicated Instances
  * Allow customers to be compliant with their security standards.
  * Does not share the host of the instance
  * You cannot see the specifics of the host
* Dedicated Host
  * Same as a dedicated hosts, but allows to see the number of physical cores
  * Fix the issue of licensing

## Placement groups

* Cluster
  * Servers are deployed closed to each others (Not SLA)
* Spread
  * Servers are deployed separated from each other
  * A spread placement group can span multiple Availability Zones, and you can have a maximum of seven running instances per Availability Zone per group
